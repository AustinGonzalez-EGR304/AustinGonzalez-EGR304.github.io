## Overview
My segment of the project focuses on the fertilizer distribution and water distribution subsection, which is responsible for delivering water and fertilizer to the individual plants. This will be achieved using a MOSFET-controlled 9V submersible pump and 2 5v h-bridge controlled motors. The system will also include an indicator light to display any potential fault conditions. Additionally, I am implementing four dedicated communication channels to enable both the reception of information from teammates and the passing of messages through the system to others.
*NOTE*: Spare connections shown on individual BOM, Team BOM represents used connections.
