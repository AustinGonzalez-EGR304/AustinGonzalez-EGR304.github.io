## Overview
My segment of the project focuses on the water distribution system, which is responsible for delivering water to the individual plants. This will be achieved using a MOSFET-controlled 9V submersible pump. The system will also include an indicator light to display any potential fault conditions. Additionally, I am implementing four dedicated communication channels to enable both the reception of information from teammates and the passing of messages through the system to others.
