## Overview

This schematic is design to support camera actuation featurting 2 stepper motors and drivers to provide near 360 degree camera control horizontally and up to 180 degrees vertically. It also features a serial hall effect sensor to allow for near real time camera postion and a repeatable home postion for start up. The logic of this system is handled by an ESP32 microcontroller. The stepper motors and drivers are all powered via a12v power supply and the microcontroller is suppliedd 3.3v via a buck regulator.
