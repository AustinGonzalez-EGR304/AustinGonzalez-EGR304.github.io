title: Module's Selected Major Components

## My Role & Responsibilities

I am responsible for the Camera Actuation subsystem. This subsystem controls two stepper motor drivers to rotate a low-weight camera and uses a Hall effect sensor to establish a repeatable “home” position reference. The microcontroller generates STEP and DIR pulse signals (and enable control) for each motor driver, reads the Hall sensor as a digital interrupt input for homing, and communicates with the Control subsystem through a UART RX/TX link. The subsystem uses a 12V motor power rail for the stepper drivers/motors and a regulated 3.3V rail for the microcontroller and logic signals. The design prioritizes clean power distribution, grounding, and debouncing/filtering to prevent motor noise from causing resets or false home triggers.

The TI DRV5053 was selected as the analog Hall sensor option for repeatable home position detection during camera sweep startup. Its linear analog output provides a measurable voltage proportional to magnetic field strength, allowing the ESP32 to determine the home threshold using the ADC. This enables more precise positioning compared to a digital switch by allowing firmware-based filtering, hysteresis, and calibration for consistent repeatability.
